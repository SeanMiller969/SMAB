# SMAB
A steam market analysis bot


This project consists of a text interface designed to scrape the Steam Marketplace and obtain an array of JSONs. To compile and run the program, install all supplementary python files along with main.py and run main.py in an ide or compile it. It takes in a specific case and the link to the Steam Marketplace file and based off of the individual link collects JSON data. Moving forward, code will be added to read through the JSON and find numbers based off of it to crunch. An example currently exists based off of the Gamma Case, it is currently runnable.
